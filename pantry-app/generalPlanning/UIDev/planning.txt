Thoughts/Questions:
    How will the app display recipes
    How will users access their recipes
    How do you add a new recipes
    Are recipes filtered/sorted
    Do recipes have tags
    How will images be displayed
    What functionalities are provided to the user
    What is displayed to the user at each point during the user's use of the app (vague on purpose)

Functionality Ideas:
    Button to add recipe on main page
    dropdown to choose method of sorting
    text field to choose tags to filter by
